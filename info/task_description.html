    You have to write a function named
    <code>davasaan</code> (division with all vowels a)
    which calculates integer division by 10.
    <br>
    The vowels "<code>eiou</code>" are disallowed as are the slash "<code>/</code>",
    asterisk "<code>*</code>", and period "<code>.</code>" characters.

    We have one more rule for this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univocalic">univocalic</a> challenge.
    This is a code golf mission and your main goal is to make your code as short as possible.
    <br>
    <strong>300 characters</strong> is the maximum allowable.
    <br>
    The shorter your code, the more remarkable you are.
    You should share your score in the title of your solution.
    <br>
    Note that empty lines and commented lines are not considered for code length, but comments at the end of a line are.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input:</strong> A non-negative number as an integer.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output:</strong> The integer division (<code>//10</code>) of the input as an integer.

    <strong>How it is used:</strong>
    This is about hacks and tricks in python which help you to shorten your code.
    You don't need to use this in production, but it can help for deeper comprehension of Python.
